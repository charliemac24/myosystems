You are an expert front-end developer and UI designer. Build a ONE-PAGE website for “MYO Systems” using ONLY a single HTML file (no separate CSS/JS files). The output must be a single file named: index.html.

REQUIREMENTS
- Single HTML file only (all CSS in a <style> tag, all JS in a <script> tag at the bottom).
- No frameworks (no React/Next/Tailwind/Bootstrap). Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only.
- Premium, high-end theme (clean, confident, modern). Avoid “gamer neon” vibes. Use subtle accent styling that feels upscale.
- Responsive, mobile-first, professional and premium look.
- Smooth scrolling for nav links.
- Sticky top navbar with CTA button “Request a Demo”.
- The messaging “Modernize Your Operations” must be CLEAR and CONSISTENT across the page. It should read as the core promise:
  - Mention it prominently in the hero
  - Reinforce it in the Company Snapshot
  - Tie it explicitly to the product outcomes (less manual work, more visibility, reliable reporting)
  - Echo it again near the footer
- Sections in this order:
  1) Hero
  2) Company Snapshot
  3) Products (flagship product card)
  4) Problem
  5) How It Works
  6) Features
  7) Sample SMS
  8) Why Schools Choose Us
  9) About (Company + Founder)
  10) Contact / Demo (form)
  11) Footer
- Use semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer), one H1 only.
- Add basic SEO meta tags (title, description, OG tags).
- Use accessible color contrast and focus states.
- Add subtle animations (fade/slide on scroll) using small vanilla JS + CSS (IntersectionObserver).
- Provide a clean layout: max-width container, cards with soft borders, subtle highlight, tasteful shadows, premium spacing.
- Use system fonts or Google Fonts via <link> (allowed). Choose a modern premium font pairing (e.g., Inter + Sora or Inter + DM Sans).
- Include a hero “portrait” placeholder on the right side (do NOT embed real image). Use:
  <img src="founder.png" alt="Charlie, Founder and Lead Developer" />
  and style it as a premium framed image with a subtle accent edge (not too bright). (Assume founder.png will be in same folder.)
- Include a “Products” card for:
  “MYO Attendance + SMS Alerts (for Schools)”
- Contact form should not require a backend. Implement a simple JS handler that:
  - Validates required fields
  - On submit, shows an inline success message: “Thanks! Your request has been received. We’ll get back to you soon.”
  - Does NOT actually send anything.
- Add a “Back to top” small button that appears after scrolling down.
- Ensure all copy matches the content provided below exactly (you may adjust minor punctuation/line breaks but keep meaning and structure).

PROBLEM:
Title: Attendance shouldn’t be stressful—for staff or parents.
Paragraph:
Manual attendance logs and delayed updates create confusion. Staff lose time reconciling records, and parents worry when there’s no confirmation. MYO Attendance + SMS Alerts modernizes daily attendance by keeping the process fast at the gate and clear for everyone.
Pain points:
- Manual logging is slow during peak gate hours
- Records can become inconsistent over time
- Parents don’t get real-time confirmation
- Monthly reporting becomes a manual task

HOW IT WORKS:
Title: How MYO Attendance + SMS Alerts works
Step 1: Student taps ID at the gate — Entry/exit is recorded instantly with timestamp and event type.
Step 2: Parent receives an SMS alert — Parents get notified seconds after the tap—arrival and departure.
Step 3: Admin dashboard stays updated — Logs are searchable and export-ready anytime.
Mini flow line: Tap → Record → Notify → Report

FEATURES:

1. Entry + Exit Tracking — consistent arrival/departure logs
